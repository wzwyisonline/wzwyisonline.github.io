    <h2>The Criticism Beggar</h2>
  {{
"
**One-Liner**
    
Please criticise. No-holds-barred. [Here](#email) maybe.
    
**Long-Ass**
    
Are you annoyed or even seething from seeing the dumbness strewn about in this article? Or have you wasted your time reading this monumental PoS, and you insist I refund your lost time down to every single millisecond?
    
1) I'm not a time wizard. No time refund.
    
2) Please take advantage of your rage and assert your superiority over me by criticising anything you want. No-holds-barred is the minimum. This is a criticism-inclusive zone; make it brutal if that's your style.
    
Seriously: I've been a habitual compliment fisher and criticism evader for all my life. You are doing me a huge favour by being generous with your honest criticisms and stingy with your compliments.
    
It's also nice if the criticisms are constructive, but I've already asked too much from you so please ignore that request if it's preventing you from criticising.
    
Leave your criticisms here. Or write it anywhere you want, and if you have the time, let me know where; criticisms are more fun when you know the intended recipient gets to see them and be enraged.
    
Many thanks for reading this long-ass criticism begging. I won't beg for likes and shares, thank you very much.
    
Have a good day and may your life be fulfilling.

###### PS. Hopefully the red background amped your aggression a bit.
